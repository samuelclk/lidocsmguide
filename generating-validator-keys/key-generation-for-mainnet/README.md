# ðŸš€ Key Generation for Mainnet

## Important

* It is highly recommended that you perform this step using an air-gapped machine - i.e. a device that has never connected to the public internet before. We will describe a few methods below.
* If this is not available, turn off all internet and wireless connection (e.g. Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth) before proceeding with the key generation step
* In both cases above, make sure you are in a safe environment (e.g. home or office) with a trusted WiFi network for building the validator key generation tool from source. Make sure to also physically block all camera devices - e.g. laptop cameras, Webcams, people standing behind you during this process

## Creating an air-gapped machine

1. The least technical way is to buy a cheap single board computer like the Raspberry Pi from official distributors for less than S$100 SGD
2. **"OS-on-a-stick":** For more technical workarounds, we can flash a new USB drive with TailsOS and run a completely fresh OS from this USB drive itself. This system will be completely isolated from your host device (e.g. working laptop) and the described method below will not store any files after you remove the USB drive

#### _**We will cover Method 2 in this guide.**_&#x20;

## What you will need

1. 2 new and empty USB drives
2. A paper notebook and a pencil (Pens are not recommended)
3. _**100% FOCUS**_

## Download the validator keystore generation file

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Wagyu Keygen" %}
This is the easiest GUI-based method of generating your validator keystores, deposit data, and recovery seed (mnemonic).

Download the Linux executable file onto your working laptop here: [https://wagyu.gg/](https://wagyu.gg/)

Load the Linux executable file of Wagyu Keygen into a new and empty USB drive.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Executable binaries" %}
### Downloading the executable binary file

Download the latest version of the Ethereum validator deposit key generation binary file **on your working laptop** [here](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases) and verify the checksum of the downloaded zipped file.

```sh
cd
curl -LO https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases/download/v2.7.0/staking_deposit-cli-fdab65d-linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo "ac3151843d681c92ae75567a88fbe0e040d53c21368cc1ed1a8c3d9fb29f2a3a staking_deposit-cli-fdab65d-linux-amd64.tar.gz" | sha256sum --check
```

**Expected output:**

```
staking_deposit-cli-fdab65d-linux-amd64.tar.gz: OK
```

After the checksum verification, move the zipped file into a new and empty USB drive.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Build from source" %}
\*No action needed at this step.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Flash and install OS

1\) Download latest TailsOS [here](https://tails.net/install/download/) and follow the respective instructions to verify the checksums of the downloaded file.

2\) Download an ISO flasher (e.g. [BalenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)) and flash another new and empty USB drive with your preferred OS. Refer to the sub-section if needed.

[tailsos-on-usb-as-air-gapped-machine.md](tailsos-on-usb-as-air-gapped-machine.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

3\) Once your USB drive is flashed with your preferred OS, plug it into your working device and reboot the device to go into the boot menu. Depending on your system, you might need to hold `F2`, `F10`, `F12`, or `ESC` during the rebooting process to bring up the boot menu.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need to connect your node device to a keyboard and monitor for the installation process

## Generate your validator signing keys

### \*BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE NEXT STEP

1. #### TURN OFF YOUR ETHERNET, WIFI, AND BLUETOOTH ACCESS&#x20;
2. #### PHYSICALLY COVER ALL CAMERA DEVICES - e.g. PHONES, WEBCAMS, LAPTOP CAMERAS, PEOPLE STANDING BEHIND YOU

Load the USB drive containing the Linux executable file of `Wagyu Keygen` onto the newly booted _**"OS-on-a-USB".**_

Move the `Wagyu Keygen` file into the Desktop of your _**"OS-on-a-USB"**_ and run it (double-click).

Follow the instructions on the `Wagyu Keygen` GUI to:

1. Create a new secret recovery phrase
2. Select the network (e.g., Mainnet, Holesky)
3. Write down your secret recovery phrase
4. Type in your secret recovery phrase manually to confirm you have written it down correctly
5. Choose how many validator keys you want to generate
6. Encrypt your validator keystores with a strong password
7. **\[IMPORTANT]** Set your withdrawal address to the `Lido Withdrawal Vault`
   * **Mainnet:** [`0xB9D7934878B5FB9610B3fE8A5e441e8fad7E293f`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9d7934878b5fb9610b3fe8a5e441e8fad7e293f)

8. Confirm password for validator keystores
9. Choose the folder to store the validator keystores and deposit data file that will be generated (choose the Desktop folder here)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not set your withdrawal address to the `Lido Withdrawal Vault` if you are generating validator keys for non-CSM use.
{% endhint %}

**There will be 2 files generated.**&#x20;

1. A `keystore-m_<timestamp>.json` file: This is your validator signing keystore that your validator node will use to sign attestations. Keep this file extremely secure.
2. A `deposit_data-<timestamp>.json`: This is the file that links your ETH deposit to your validator. You will only use this once, during the deposit process.

Store both files on a new USB drive by copying the entire staking-deposit-cli folder into it.&#x20;

Restart your host device (e.g. working laptop) and remove the OS-on-a-stick. There will not be any persistent memory stored on it.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Executable binaries" %}
Load the USB drive containing the `keystore generation zipped file` onto the newly booted _**"OS-on-a-USB".**_

Copy the `keystore generation zipped file` into the Desktop of your _**"OS-on-a-USB".**_

Press `ALT+T`, then extract the contents of the zipped file and change directory into the extracted folder.

```sh
cd Desktop
tar xvf staking_deposit-cli-fdab65d-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd staking_deposit-cli-fdab65d-linux-amd64
