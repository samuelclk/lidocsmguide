# ðŸ”‘ Generating Validator Keys

Before you can run validators in the Community Staking Module, you need to generate your validator keys. These keys secure 32+ ETH each and are tasked with signing attestations and proposing blocksâ€”so generating them properly and securely is a must.

In this section, weâ€™ll guide you through the process of generating validator keys, with options depending on whether you're deploying on testnet or mainnet.

Choose the path that matches your current stage:

{% content-ref url="key-generation-for-testnet.md" %}
[key-generation-for-testnet.md](key-generation-for-testnet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="key-generation-for-mainnet/" %}
[key-generation-for-mainnet](key-generation-for-mainnet/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** We strongly recommend testing your setup on a testnet first, especially if this is your first time operating a validator or using a new stack.
