# ðŸ§± Node Setup

Setting up your node is the first step to validate Ethereum and participate in the Community Staking Module. To make things easier and more accessible, weâ€™ve divided this section into three tracksâ€”**Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**â€”based on your familiarity with Ethereum staking and comfort level with server management.

Each track includes guides tailored to different node management tools and preferences. Whether youâ€™re using a plug-and-play solution or building your stack from scratch, youâ€™ll find step-by-step resources here to get started.

**Choose your track:**
