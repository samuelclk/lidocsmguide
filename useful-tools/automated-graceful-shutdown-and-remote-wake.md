# Automated Graceful Shutdown & Remote Wake

For operators who spend lots of time away from home with frequent power trips, you may want to set up  the following:

1. Add an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to your setup. This is basically a back-up battery for your node
2. Configure your node to gracefully shutdown automatically when main line power is cut and turn itself back on when main line power is restored
3. Manually turn your node back on remotely as a failsafe
